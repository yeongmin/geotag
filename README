*GeoTag : Geo tagging tool using iPhone's backup data.

*Prerequisites:
 - For MAC OS X 
	install ExifTool-8.56 from http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/

 - For Ubuntu
	sudo apt-get install libimage-exiftool-perl

*Usage:
	geotag [iphone backup data path] [imgs path]
	eg) ./geotag /User/yeongmin/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/21e23s31... /User/yeongmin/myphotos

 - default location of iphone backup data is 
	/User/<user name>/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/<random string>/
 - devices can be distinguished by investigating info.plist under <random string> directory.
 - imgs path can be an img file itself or directory of imgs.

 - geotag backs up original images with 'original' postfix in the same location.
 - default adaptable time difference between gps information and photos is half an hour. 
 - be aware of inaccurate location information of iPhone's backup data.
